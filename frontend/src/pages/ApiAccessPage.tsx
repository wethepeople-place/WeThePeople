/**
 * Public-facing API & data-access overview.
 *
 * Surfaces the existing register + create-key flow so journalists,
 * researchers, and developers can self-serve. Documents:
 *   - The three tiers (free / pro / enterprise) and their daily quotas
 *   - The /docs Swagger UI for endpoint reference
 *   - The /export/{table}.csv per-table downloads
 *   - The /bulk/snapshot nightly SQLite dump
 *   - The HuggingFace dataset (once published)
 *
 * No new backend wiring — this page is documentation. The endpoints it
 * describes are live as of this commit (see `routers/bulk.py` and
 * `routers/auth.py`).
