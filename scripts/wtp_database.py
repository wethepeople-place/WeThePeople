WeThePeople Database Evidence Source for Veritas

Searches the WTP SQLite database for evidence matching claims.
Always searches ALL data types (lobbying, contracts, trades, committees,
donations, enforcement) for every matched entity. No keyword gating.
Snippets are written to maximize BM25 score overlap with claim text.
