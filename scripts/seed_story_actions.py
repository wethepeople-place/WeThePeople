"""Seed StoryAction rows for every published story.

Phase 2 ships an Action Panel at the bottom of every story: 1-3 concrete,
time-bounded next steps the reader can take in under a minute. Until this
script runs, the panel renders empty because no `story_actions` rows exist.

The seeder picks action templates from a recipe table keyed by
(category, sector). Each story gets 2-3 actions: a mix of passive
("switch_provider", "check_redress", "verify_data") and active
("call_rep", "register_to_vote", "attend_hearing"). The frontend
StoryActionPanel groups by `is_passive` so the disengaged-audience
reader can pick a low-commitment action without doing politics.

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_story_actions.py --dry-run
    python scripts/seed_story_actions.py
    python scripts/seed_story_actions.py --slug some-story-slug   # one story
    python scripts/seed_story_actions.py --replace                # wipe + reseed

The seeder is idempotent in default mode: it skips any story that
already has at least one StoryAction row. Pass --replace to wipe and
reseed every targeted story (use this after editing the recipes).

#
# Each recipe is a dict matching the StoryAction column shape:
#
#   action_type   — one of StoryAction.VALID_TYPES
#   title         — primary CTA (under 60 chars renders best)
#   description   — 1-2 sentence description
#   is_passive    — 1 = passive (switch banks, check redress);
#                   0 = active (call rep, attend hearing)
#   geographic_filter — None (universal) or a state filter (rare)
#   script_template — optional; required for call_rep
#   external_url  — destination
#   display_order — lower = higher up
#
# Verification is layered:
#   1. (category, sector) lookup — most specific
#   2. (category, "*")    lookup — category-only fallback
#   3. SECTOR_DEFAULTS[sector] — always-on sector actions
#   4. UNIVERSAL_DEFAULTS — last-resort (verify_data + register_to_vote)
#
# The seeder de-duplicates by (action_type, external_url) so layering
# can't produce two of the same row.

# register_to_vote is THE action we recommend to every reader, on every
# story. It sits at display_order=1 so it always renders first inside
# the active-actions group. The frontend StoryActionPanel groups passive
# vs active separately; this lives in the active group and gets a
# subtle "primary" treatment via the sub-1 display_order.
#
# The previous "Read the underlying data" generic verify_data row
# pointed at the wethepeople.place homepage and duplicated the
# story's own "Verify This Yourself" sources section at the bottom of
# the page. Removed.
