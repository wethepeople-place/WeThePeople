# Pre-fix the API served raw JSON regardless of the client's
# Accept-Encoding header — the /anomalies?limit=100 response wired
# 82 KB over the network even though gzip would have brought it
# under 10 KB. JSON compresses 5-10x, and the worst-offender endpoints
# (/anomalies, /people, /aggregate/*/contracts at 100-500 KB raw)
# all dominate cold-load latency on slow connections.
#
# `minimum_size=1024` skips compression on small payloads where
# the framing overhead would actually slow things down. `compresslevel=6`
# is the standard balance — level 9 gains <2% size at ~10x CPU cost.
# nginx in front of uvicorn could also do this, but doing it here
# guarantees the behavior regardless of how prod is fronted.
