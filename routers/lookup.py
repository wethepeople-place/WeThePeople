"""
Zip Code Lookup — Rich representative profiles by zip code.

GET /lookup/{zip_code}
  Maps zip → district via:
    1. data/zip_district_overrides.json — local override file for ZIPs
       where whoismyrepresentative.com returns stale data (pre-2022
       redistricting, retired reps). Hand-curated; authoritative.
    2. whoismyrepresentative.com — public lookup, but its dataset is
       often years stale. We validate the returned name against
       TrackedMember; if no current member matches, we fall back.
    3. All active state members — graceful fallback so the user always
       sees their senators even when the House district can't be
       resolved precisely.

  Returns trades, donors, committees, anomalies, and votes for each
  matched member — all in batch queries.
