          The Influence Journal is the publishing arm of WeThePeople, an open civic
          transparency platform. Every story we publish is governed by the standards
          on this page. We update this page when our practices change; the change log
          appears at the bottom.
        </p>

        <h2 style={h2Style}>What we publish</h2>
        <p style={proseStyle}>
          We publish original reporting and data briefs that draw exclusively from
          public records: lobbying disclosures, federal contracts, congressional
          stock trades, foreign agent registrations, campaign finance filings,
          enforcement actions, roll call votes, and bill texts. Every claim links to
          its underlying source record. Where we make a join across multiple records,
          we link to all of them.

        <h2 style={h2Style}>How we verify</h2>
        <p style={proseStyle}>
          Every claim in every story passes through Veritas, our verification
          engine. Veritas is a deterministic source-matching layer, not a
          language model. It performs structured comparisons of each claim
          against the underlying primary-source records: lookup by record ID
          where one is asserted, BM25 lexical matching against the originating
          government dataset where one is not, double-count detection across
          time windows, cross-record contradiction checks, source-tier scoring,
          and a cross-reference against our verified-fact vault. The engine
          does not generate text. It approves, rejects, or flags claims for
          editorial review based on whether the cited source supports them.
          Stories whose claims cannot be verified to at least our defined
          floor are not published. The verification methodology is publicly
          documented at <Link to="/verify-our-data" style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent-text)', textDecoration: 'underline', textUnderlineOffset: '3px' }}>/verify-our-data</Link>.

            A note on Veritas and the AP standard.
          </strong>
          AP's guidance is explicit: AI-generated output cannot itself verify
          AI-generated output. Veritas is built around that constraint. It does
          not call any language model. It performs structured lookups against
          primary-source datasets, BM25 lexical matching, and rule-based
          contradiction detection. The verification verdict on any given claim
          can be reproduced by re-running Veritas against the same inputs and
          will return the same result. This is a different category of system
          than an LLM-as-judge, and the distinction matters for any reader who
          is evaluating whether our verification is meaningful.
        </div>

        <h2 style={h2Style}>How we handle errors</h2>
        <p style={proseStyle}>
          When we discover an error in a published story, we correct it promptly
          and record the correction on our public corrections page. Corrections
          name what changed, why it changed, and when. If an error is severe
          enough that the story should not have been published, we retract the
          story and explain why. We do not silently edit published stories. We
          do not remove stories from the archive when we correct or retract them.

        <h2 style={h2Style}>Right of response</h2>
        <p style={proseStyle}>
          For investigative stories that name a specific company, official, or
          private individual, we send a request for comment to that party at least
          24 hours before publication, listing the specific claims we intend to
          publish about them. Responses received before publication are reflected
          in the story. Responses received after publication are appended to the
          story as updates and dated.

        <h2 style={h2Style}>AI disclosure</h2>

          narrative prose from a structured skeleton, and &ldquo;Human-Written&rdquo;
          for stories drafted by a human reporter. Every story passes through human
          editorial review before publication regardless of the production label.

        <h2 style={h2Style}>Editorial governance</h2>
        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The Influence Journal currently operates under the editorial direction
          of Dshon Smith, founder of WeThePeople. We are recruiting an editorial
