## What is this?

WeThePeople is an open-source civic social video network where people share perspectives on public issues, explore trusted data insights, propose solutions, and turn conversation into accountable action. Its evidence layer draws from 40+ government APIs across 11 sectors and all 50 states, tracking 537 politicians and 1,000+ companies. Every data point links back to its authoritative public source.

## The Ecosystem

| Platform | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **[WeThePeople](https://app.wethepeople.place)** | Deployment in progress | The full civic application, hosted separately from the public landing page. |
| **WTP Research** | Planned | Deep-dive civic research tools; its production subdomain is not configured yet. |
| **The Influence Journal** | Planned | Data investigations remain in editorial and infrastructure review. |
| **Veritas Verify** | Planned | Claim-verification interface; automatic legacy deployment is disabled pending infrastructure review. |
| **Mobile App** | Preview | iOS and Android via Expo SDK 54. 45+ screens covering all 11 sectors, congressional trades, ZIP lookup, stories, anomalies, state explorer, influence network, chat agent, account/auth, watchlists, and company comparison. Available via Expo Go preview channel. |

## Quick Start

For the supported clean-clone setup, Windows commands, verification gate, and troubleshooting, see [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md). Environment variables are inventoried in [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md).

### Backend

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # No API keys required for local boot
uvicorn main:app --port 8006  # API at http://localhost:8006/docs
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

### Seed Data

```bash
python jobs/seed_tracked_companies.py        # 1,000+ entities across all sectors
python jobs/sync_votes.py                    # House roll call votes
python jobs/sync_senate_votes.py             # Senate roll call votes
python jobs/sync_congressional_trades.py     # Congressional stock trades
python jobs/sync_state_data_all.py           # State legislators + bills (50 states via OpenStates)
python jobs/sync_donations.py --sector defense  # FEC PAC sweeps per sector
```

### Backfills

```bash
# Pre-warm Haiku summaries for bills missing CRS text (top-N most-active first):
python jobs/backfill_bill_ai_summaries.py --limit 200

# One-shot DB cleanup for legacy congress.gov URLs that used the broken
# `{type}-bill/{number}` slug. Idempotent and dry-run-safe:
python scripts/backfill_normalize_congress_urls.py --dry-run
python scripts/backfill_normalize_congress_urls.py --apply
```

### Diagnostics

```bash
python scripts/diagnose_usajobs_auth.py         # Tries every USAJobs header variant
```

### USPTO patent ingest (replaces retired PatentsView)

USPTO retired PatentsView in May 2026. The replacement is the
USPTO Open Data Portal at `api.uspto.gov`. Critical architecture
change: ODP is **bulk-data only** — there is no per-patent search
endpoint like PatentsView had. To resume patent ingest you download
quarterly TSV files (the `PVGPATDIS` product is the direct successor),
parse them, and filter by assignee in our DB.

```bash
# 1. Register: https://api.uspto.gov  (self-service)
# 2. Add to .env:
#      USPTO_API_KEY=<your-key>
# 3. Verify connectivity + dataset freshness:
python scripts/diagnose_uspto_odp.py
# 4. The bulk-ingest job (download → parse → filter → tech_patents
#    table) is the next-PR work; the connector ships discovery
#    helpers (list_products, find_patent_grant_products,
#    get_product_detail, list_files_for_product) ready for it.
```

### Editorial-standards rebuild workflow

Phase 0 audit + retraction-patch generation for the May 2026
editorial-standards rebuild (see the journal `/standards` page for
the canonical rules).

```bash
# 1. Dump current published+archived stories from the DB
python scripts/dump_published_stories.py
# → writes .planning/published_stories.json

# 2. Run the regression audit against the editorial standards
python scripts/audit_published_stories.py
# → writes .planning/STORY_AUDIT_REPORT.md  (human review)
# → writes .planning/STORY_AUDIT_REPORT.json (machine-readable)

# 3. Convert audit findings into proposed retraction/revision patches
python scripts/generate_retraction_patches.py
# → writes .planning/STORY_RETRACTION_PATCHES.json

# 4. Edit the patches file. Set `approved: true` on patches you agree with.
#    Anything you don't approve stays approved=false and is skipped.

# 5. Dry-run the apply step to confirm what will change
python scripts/apply_retraction_patches.py --dry-run

# 6. Apply approved patches. Each one writes a story_corrections log
#    row in the same transaction as the status change.
python scripts/apply_retraction_patches.py --apply
```

### Mobile (Expo)

```bash
cd mobile && npm ci && npm run start
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here are some areas where help would be especially valuable:

- **New data source integrations** — More government APIs, FOIA databases, state-level data
- **State legislative data enrichment** — Bill tracking, committee votes, campaign finance at the state level
- **District-level data** — Census overlays, district-specific lobbying and spending analysis
- **Visualization improvements** — New ways to surface patterns in influence data
- **Testing** — Backend and frontend test coverage

## Citing the platform

Journalists and researchers should cite the underlying primary source first (Senate LDA, FEC, USASpending.gov, Congress.gov, etc.). When attribution to the platform is appropriate, see the [Citation Guide](https://app.wethepeople.place/cite) for recommended formats and per-dataset attribution lines.

## Editorial standards

The Influence Journal's editorial standards are published at [journal.wethepeople.place/standards](https://journal.wethepeople.place/standards) and apply to every story. The page maps each rule explicitly to the [SPJ Code of Ethics](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) and the [AP guidelines on generative AI](https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/standards-around-generative-ai/). It covers what we publish, what we refuse, how we verify, how we correct, and how we stay independent.

Veritas, our verification engine, is a deterministic source-matching layer (not a language model). The methodology is documented at [/verify-our-data](https://journal.wethepeople.place/verify-our-data).
